Multiple ports
==============
This section describes how to configure the p-net stack, sample application
and system for multiple network interfaces or ports.


Terminology
-----------

Interface
    Abstract group of ports. In Profinet context, interface typically doesn't mean a
    specific network interface. This is a common cause of confusion.
Port
    Network interface. The physical connectors are referred to as "physical ports".
    A "management port" is the network interface to which a controller / PLC connects.

In the example described in this section, ``br0`` is the management port
and ``eth0`` and ``eth1`` are the physical ports. The interface consists of
``br0``, ``eth0`` and ``eth1``.


Configuration of bridge using Linux
-----------------------------------
Tested with Raspberry PI 3B+ and USB Ethernet dongle USB3GIG.

            +-------------+
            |    br0      |
            +------+------+
            | eth0 | eth1 |
            +------+------+


p-net supports multiple Ethernet ports. To use multiple ports, these
shall be grouped into a bridge. In such a configuration the management port / main network interface
is the bridge and the Ethernet interfaces are named physical ports.

To create a bridge and add network interfaces to it, create the following files and content::

    # /etc/systemd/network/bridge-br0.netdev
    [NetDev]
    Name=br0
    Kind=bridge

    # /etc/systemd/network/br0-member-eth0.network
    [Match]
    Name=eth0
    [Network]
    Bridge=br0

    # /etc/systemd/network/br0-member-eth1.network
    [Match]
    Name=eth1
    [Network]
    Bridge=br0

Enable and start network deamon::

    sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd
    sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd

Run ``ifconfig`` to check that the bridge is up and its network interfaces are all up::

    pi@pndevice-pi:~$ ifconfig
    br0: flags=4419<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

    eth0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

    eth1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

Configuration of p-net stack and sample application (TBD)
---------------------------------------------------------
To run p-net and the sample application with multiple ports a couple
of things need to be done:

* Reconfigure setting ``PNET_MAX_PORT`` to the actual number of physical ports available in the system.
  For this example ``PNET_MAX_PORT`` shall be set to 2.

* TBD - update this document when multiport support is implemented
