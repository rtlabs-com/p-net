Additional Linux Details
========================
The tutorial gives most information required for getting started on a Linux
machine. Some additional information is given here.


Detailed dependency installation info
-------------------------------------
You need to have cmake version at least 3.14 installed. It is available in
Ubuntu 19.04 and later.

To install on Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, follow the instructions here:
https://blog.kitware.com/ubuntu-cmake-repository-now-available/

It is also possible to install it via snap::

    sudo snap install cmake --classic

When using it, you might need to replace ``cmake`` with ``snap run cmake``.
If uninstalling the default ``cmake``, the snap-installed version should be
used by default after reboot.

Optional dependencies (for development and documentation of the p-net stack)::

    sudo apt install -y \
        clang-tools \
        clang-format-10 \
        doxygen \
        graphviz


Run tests and generate documentation
------------------------------------
Run tests (if you told cmake to configure it)::

    cmake --build build --target check

Run a single test file::

    build/pf_test --gtest_filter=CmrpcTest.CmrpcConnectReleaseTest

Create Doxygen documentation::

    cmake --build build --target docs

The Doxygen documentation ends up in ``build/html/index.html``

See the "Writing documentation" page if you would like to install
the toolchain to build the entire Sphinx documentation.

The clang static analyzer can also be used if installed. Create a new
build directory by running::

   scan-build cmake -B build.scan-build -S p-net
   scan-build cmake --build build


Setting Linux ephemeral port range
----------------------------------
This is the range of random source ports used when sending UDP messages.
Profinet requires that the UDP source port should be >= 0xC000, which is 49152
in decimal numbers.

To change the ephemeral port range::

    echo "49152 60999" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range

This should typically be done at system start up.


File size and memory usage on Linux
-----------------------------------
The resulting file size of the sample application binary is heavily dependent
on the compile time options, for example whether to include debug information.
In this example we use::

   BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release
   LOG_LEVEL Warning
   PNET_MAX_AR 2
   PNET_MAX_SLOTS 5
   PNET_MAX_SUBSLOTS 3

To get an estimate of the binary size, partially link it (use release, without
standard libraries)::

   p-net/build$ make all
   p-net/build$ /usr/bin/cc -O3 -DNDEBUG CMakeFiles/pn_dev.dir/sample_app/sampleapp_common.o CMakeFiles/pn_dev.dir/src/ports/linux/sampleapp_main.o -o pn_dev libprofinet.a -nostdlib -r

Resulting size::

   p-net/build$ size pn_dev
      text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   244481	     72	      8	 244561	  3bb51	pn_dev

See https://linux.die.net/man/1/size for information on how to use the command.
Also the rt-kernel page in this documentation has some description on how to
interpret the output.

The size of the p-net stack can be estimated from the size of libprofinet,
built with the options given above::

   p-net/build$ size libprofinet.so
      text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   230888	   3304	      8	 234200	  392d8	libprofinet.so

An estimate of the p-net RAM usage can be made from the size of the pnet_t struct.
The sample application has a command line option to show this value, for the used
compile time options (for example the maximum number of modules allowed).


Debug intermittent segmentation faults during tests on Linux
------------------------------------------------------------
Enable core dumps::

    ulimit -c unlimited

Run a test case until the problem occurs (in the build directory)::

    while ./pf_test --gtest_filter=DiagTest.DiagRunTest; do :; done

Study the resulting core::

    gdb pf_test core


SNMP (Conformance class B)
--------------------------
Conformance class B requires SNMP support. Linux uses net-snmp as agent,
see http://www.net-snmp.org/. P-Net for Linux implements
a Net-SNMP subagent that handles the Profinet mandatory MIB:s. Also
see :ref:`network-topology-detection` for information regarding SNMP.

Enable SNMP by setting ``PNET_OPTION_SNMP`` to ``ON``. Net-SNMP also needs to
be installed. On Ubuntu you can install the required packages using::

  sudo apt install -y snmpd libsnmp-dev

The p-net SNMP subagent will handle the system objects so the default
SNMP system module should be disabled by adding the snmpd argument
``-I -system_mib``. On Ubuntu Linux you should change
``/lib/systemd/system/snmpd.service`` to read::

  [Unit]
  Description=Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Daemon.
  After=network.target
  ConditionPathExists=/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p /var/run/agentx
  ExecStart=/usr/sbin/snmpd -LOw -u Debian-snmp -g Debian-snmp -I -system_mib,smux,mteTrigger,mteTriggerConf -f -p /run/snmpd.pid
  ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target

To see the status of the service::

   systemctl status snmpd.service
   journalctl -u snmpd.service -f

To restart the service after modification::

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart snmpd.service

The file ``snmpd.conf`` controls access to the snmp agent. It should be
set to listen on all interfaces and allow read-write access to the
Profinet MIB:s. On Ubuntu Linux you should change
``/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`` to read::

   master  agentx
   agentaddress  0.0.0.0,[::1]
   view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
   view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2
   view   systemonly  included   .1.0.8802.1.1.2
   rocommunity  public  default -V systemonly
   rwcommunity  private default -V systemonly

If your Linux distribution does give a long description for ``ifDesc`` you can
override it by adding a line to the ``snmpd.conf`` file. Adapt the interface
index (last digit in OID) and the interface name::

   override 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.3 octet_str "enp0s31f6"

See :ref:`network-topology-detection` for more details on SNMP and how to
verify the SNMP communication to the p-net stack.


snmpd in a Yocto build
----------------------
In an embedded Linux Yocto build, you would include the ``snmpd`` daemon by
using the ``net-snmp`` recipe.


Persistent logs
---------------
To make the journalctl logs persistent between restarts::

   sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
   sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal

Remove all contents of the journalctl logs::

   sudo journalctl --rotate
   sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s


Boot time optimization
----------------------
The boot time should be less than approximately 15 seconds, for the "missing
peer" alarm to be sent within 30 s after the power on.

To improve the startup time of your Linux device, it is useful to study what
is delaying the start. If you use the "systemd" init system, you can use these
commands to analyze the startup::

   systemd-analyze
   systemd-analyze blame
   systemd-analyze critical-chain pnet-sampleapp.service
