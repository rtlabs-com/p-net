Installation and configuration of Raspberry Pi
==============================================
This page consists of an installation guide to use if you have a Linux laptop,
and a separate guide to use with a Windows laptop.

The P-Net stack and sample application has been tested with:

* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

To avoid problems it is recommended to start with a fresh
Raspberry Pi OS image.

When running the Raspberry Pi as a Profinet IO-device using P-Net, the
network settings of the Raspberry Pi will be changed by Profinet.
Therefore it is highly recommended to use a keyboard, mouse and monitor or
a serial cable.

If you use SSH you may end up in a situation were you have difficulties
connecting to, or recovering your device. If you currently do not have a
suitable USB-to-serial cable you can still build and run P-Net with the
sample application but you might run into problem when a PLC is used for
configuration.


Installation using a Linux laptop
---------------------------------
#. Burn an SD-card with Raspberry Pi OS, by using the "Raspberry Pi imager"
   software and an SD card reader.
   A card size of 16 - 32 GByte is recommended.
   Follow the instructions on the page https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
   Select the standard "Raspberry Pi OS" operating system.

#. Unplug, and reinsert your SD-card to mount it. To enable SSH logging in on the
   Raspberry Pi, create an empty file on the named :file:`ssh` in the boot partition::

    touch ssh

#. To enable the serial port console add this line to the
   file :file:`config.txt` in the boot partition::

    enable_uart=1

   The DHCP client daemon will adjust the network interface settings automatically.
   This interferes with the P-Net control of the Ethernet interface. So if you
   run your Raspberry Pi as a Profinet IO-Device (NOT if you use it as a PLC)
   and have a serial cable, you need to add this line to :file:`/etc/dhcpcd.conf`
   in the root file system::

    denyinterfaces eth*

#. If you would like to change hostname from ``raspberrypi`` to ``pndevice-pi``, change
   the texts in the files :file:`etc/hostname` and :file:`etc/hosts` in the rootfs
   partition.

#. To make sure that you subsequently are logging in to the correct Raspberry Pi,
   you can create a file in the home directory in the rootfs partition. Change
   name to something informative, for example::

    touch home/pi/IAmAProfinetDevice

#. Unmount the SD-card, and plug it in into your Raspberry Pi.

#. Power up the Raspberry Pi and log in to it via a serial cable (see below).
   Use the username ``pi`` and the default password ``raspberry``.

   If you do not have any serial cable (and not have disabled DHCP), connect
   the Raspberry Pi to your local network.
   Find the IP address of it by running this on a Linux machine on the network
   (replace the hostname if you have changed it)::

    ping raspberrypi.local

   Verify that it is the correct machine by checking that is disappears when the
   power is disconnected.

   Log in to it::

    ssh pi@<IP>

   Enter the password mentioned just above.

If you would connect your Raspberry Pi to a WiFi network, follow the
guide in https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html

You might also want to disable the splash screen and to expand the file system,
by using the :command:`raspi-config` utility.

.. note:: If you are following the "Running the sample application on a Raspberry Pi" tutorial and are setting up the IO-device,
          you should head back now. See :ref:`running-sample-app`.

Installation using a Windows laptop
-----------------------------------
This section describes how to install the Raspberry Pi OS
and how to enable ssh and serial console so that the Raspberry Pi can be
used in headless mode without a display and keyboard connected.

#. Write Raspberry Pi OS image to SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager.

   * Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager from
     https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
   * Start Raspberry Pi Imager
   * In the Select OS dialog choose full version
   * Select SD-card
   * Press Write

#. Initial configuration of Raspberry Pi OS.

   * Eject SD-card
   * Reinsert SD-card in windows PC. The SD-card will be shown as external drive named ``boot``.
   * Enable ssh by creating an empty file named :file:`ssh` in the root folder of ``boot``.
     The windows file explorer can be used for this.
     Note that the file :file:`ssh` shall not have a txt file extension.
   * Enable serial port console.
     Open :file:`config.txt` in root folder of ``boot`` using Notepad.
     Add the line ``enable_uart=1`` to the end of the file.
     Save file and close Notepad.
   * Eject SD-card

#. Start Raspberry Pi

   * Insert SD-card and power on Raspberry Pi.
   * Login (preferably using serial console) with default user ``pi`` and password ``raspberry``.

#4. Network configuration.

   Use the nano editor to edit the configuration files as described below.
   For example to edit the :file:`/etc/dhcpcd.conf`::

    sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

   Save the file in nano by pressing ``CTRL-X``, then ``Y`` and ``Enter``.

   The DHCP client daemon will adjust the network interface settings automatically.
   This interferes with the P-Net control of the Ethernet interface. So if you
   run your Raspberry Pi as a Profinet IO-Device (NOT if you use it as a PLC)
   and have a serial cable, you should add the line below to :file:`/etc/dhcpcd.conf`::

    denyinterfaces eth*

   Optionally, to change hostname from ``raspberrypi`` to ``pndevice-pi``, change
   the configuration in the files :file:`/etc/hostname` and :file:`/etc/hosts`.

   To make sure that you subsequently are logging in to the correct Raspberry Pi,
   you can create a file in the home directory in the rootfs partition. Change
   name to something informative, for example::

    touch /home/pi/IAmAProfinetDevice

   Reboot and the Raspberry Pi is now ready to run the P-Net sample application::

    sudo reboot

   If you would connect your Raspberry Pi to a WiFi network, follow the
   guide in https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html

   You might also want to disable the splash screen and to expand the file system,
   by using the :command:`raspi-config` utility.

.. note:: If you are following the "Running a sample application on a Raspberry Pi" tutorial and are setting up the IO-device,
          you should head back now. See :ref:`running-sample-app`.


Optionally connecting a serial cable to Raspberry Pi
----------------------------------------------------
The P-Net Profinet stack will change the IP-address of the Raspberry Pi when
running it as an IO-Device (as requested by the PLC), why it can be
inconvenient to connect to it via ssh. You can use a keyboard, mouse and a
monitor to connect to the Raspberry Pi. Using a serial cable to connect it to
your laptop can then be helpful if a keyboard etc not is available.

#. Use a USB-to-serial adapter cable with 3.3 V logic levels. For example
   Adafruit sells a popular version of those cables. Connect the USB end to your
   laptop and the other end to the header connector on the Raspberry Pi.

#. If not already done, enable the serial port console by writing the line
   ``enable_uart=1`` in the file :file:`/boot/config.txt`.

   The serial port within the Raspberry Pi will be named :file:`/dev/ttyS0`.

   +-----+-----------+---------------------+-----------------------+
   | Pin | Name      | Terminal on cable   | Adafruit cable color  |
   +=====+===========+=====================+=======================+
   | 6   | GND       | GND                 | Black                 |
   +-----+-----------+---------------------+-----------------------+
   | 8   | UART0_TXD | RX                  | White                 |
   +-----+-----------+---------------------+-----------------------+
   | 10  | UART0_RXD | TX                  | Green                 |
   +-----+-----------+---------------------+-----------------------+

   Use a communication program with a baud rate of 115200.

#. Before connecting the serial cable to your Raspberry Pi you can verify the
   functionality of the cable by connecting the USB connector to your Laptop,
   and connect the RX-terminal to the TX terminal of the cable. Use a communication
   program to verify that text that you enter is echoed back. When removing
   the RX-to-TX connection the echo should stop.

Optionally connecting LEDs and buttons to Raspberry Pi
------------------------------------------------------
You need these components:

+-----------------------+-----------------+
| Component             | Number required |
+=======================+=================+
| LED                   | 2               |
+-----------------------+-----------------+
| Button switch         | 2               |
+-----------------------+-----------------+
| Resistor 220 Ohm      | 4               |
+-----------------------+-----------------+

Connect them as follows:

+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Pin  | Name    | Description                                         |
+======+=========+=====================================================+
| 9    | GND     |                                                     |
+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 11   | GPIO17  | Connect LED1 (application data) to GND via 220 Ohm  |
+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 13   | GPIO27  | Connect Button1 to 3.3V via 220 Ohm                 |
+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 15   | GPIO22  | Connect Button2 to 3.3V via 220 Ohm                 |
+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 16   | GPIO23  | Connect LED2 (Profinet signal) to GND via 220 Ohm   |
+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 17   | 3.3V    |                                                     |
+------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+

The resistors for the buttons are to limit the consequences of connecting the
wires to wrong pins.

Set up the GPIO pins for the buttons::

    echo 22 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 27 > /sys/class/gpio/export

and for the LEDs::

    echo 17 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 23 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/direction
    echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/direction

Turn on and off a LED::

    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value

Show state of buttons::

    cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
    cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio27/value

Adjusting IP address if using the Raspberry Pi as a PLC
-------------------------------------------------------
If running your Raspberry Pi as a PLC (Profinet IO-Controller), you would like
to have a static IP address (it will not work if running as a Profinet IO-Device).
Instead modify the file :file:`/etc/dhcpcd.conf` to include these lines::

   interface eth0
   static ip_address=192.168.0.100/24

You can still ping the <hostname>.local address to find it on the network.
To re-enable DHCP, remove the lines again from :file:`/etc/dhcpcd.conf`.

Once you have prepared the IP address etc on the Raspberry Pi intended for
use as a PLC, it is time to install the Codesys runtime on it. See
:ref:`using-codesys`.

Automatic starting of sample application (advanced users only)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Use systemd to automatically start the P-Net sample application at boot on a
Raspberry Pi.
Place a systemd unit file here: :file:`/lib/systemd/system/pnet-sampleapp.service`

An example file is available in the :file:`samples/pn_dev/` directory of this
repository. It assumes that the code is checked out into
:file:`/home/pi/profinet/p-net/` on your Raspberry Pi.
Install the files::

    sudo cp /home/pi/profinet/p-net/src/ports/linux/pnet-sampleapp.service /lib/systemd/system/
    sudo cp /home/pi/profinet/p-net/src/ports/linux/enable-rpi-gpio-pins.sh /usr/bin/
    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/enable-rpi-gpio-pins.sh

Adapt the contents to your paths and hardware.

Enable automatic startup::

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable pnet-sampleapp.service

Start service::

    sudo systemctl start pnet-sampleapp.service

To see the status of the process, and the log output::

    systemctl status pnet-sampleapp.service

    journalctl -u pnet-sampleapp -f

If using a serial cable, you might need to adjust the number of visible columns::

    stty cols 150 rows 40

You can for example add it to your :file:`.bashrc` file on the Raspberry Pi.

In order to speed up the boot time, you might want to disable some functionality
not necessary for Profinet applications. For example::

   sudo systemctl disable cups-browsed.service
   sudo systemctl disable cups.service

See the section "Boot time optimization" elsewhere in this documentation.


Control of built-in LEDs (advanced users only)
----------------------------------------------
The Raspberry Pi board has LEDs on the board, typically a red PWR LED and a
green ACT (activity) LED.

Manually control the green LED (ACT = ``led0``) on Raspberry Pi 3::

    echo none > /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
    echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

And to turn it off::

    echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

Note that you need root privileges to control the LEDs.

Similarly for the red (power) LED, which is called ``led1``.


Control Linux real-time properties (advanced users only)
--------------------------------------------------------
See :ref:`linuxtiming` for an introduction to the subject.

Add this to the first (and only) line in :file:`/boot/cmdline.txt`::

   isolcpus=2

Run the sample application on a specific CPU core, by modifying the
autostart file :file:`/lib/systemd/system/pnet-sampleapp.service` (if installed)::

   ExecStart=taskset -c 2 /home/pi/profinet/build/pn_dev -v -b /sys/class/gpio/gpio27/value -d /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value


SD-card problems
----------------
If you have problems with the CPU freezing for a few seconds now and then,
the SD-card might be damaged. There is a SD-card test program available
for Raspberry Pi::

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install agnostics

Start the test program::

   pi@raspberrypi:~$ sh /usr/share/agnostics/sdtest.sh

Example output for a damaged SD-card::

   Run 1
   prepare-file;0;0;2029;3
   seq-write;0;0;2944;5
   rand-4k-write;0;0;705;176
   rand-4k-read;7444;1861;0;0
   Sequential write speed 2944 KB/sec (target 10000) - FAIL
   Note that sequential write speed declines over time as a card is used - your card may require reformatting
   Random write speed 176 IOPS (target 500) - FAIL
   Random read speed 1861 IOPS (target 1500) - PASS
