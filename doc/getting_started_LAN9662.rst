=======

Introduction
------------
Note: Add description of LAN9662 when data sheet is available.

For links to Microchip LAN9662 resources see section  :ref:`lan9662-resources`.

Known limitations:

- One byte write operations are not supported from
  LAN9662 RTE to the I/O FPGA. This means the sample submodule
  Digital Output 1x8 is not working in full rte mode.
- Submodule default values are not applied on AR tear down
  in full rte mode.

LAN9662 Profinet Solution
-------------------------

P-Net implements support for the networking hardware offload features in the LAN9662.
When hardware offload is enabled, Profinet cyclic data frames are handled by the LAN9662 Real
Time Engine (RTE). During AR / connection establishment the RTE is configured by the P-Net stack and
sending and receiving cyclic data is handed over the RTE. The P-Net stack still handles
all non-cyclic Profinet frames.

The cyclic process data is defined by the Profinet device application.
In Profinet the device input data is sent to the controller using the Producer Protocol Machine (PPM) and
the output data is received using the the Consumer Protocol Machine (CPM).
For the PPM side the RTE is configured to read input data sources and build a frame
that is periodically sent to the controller.
For the CPM side the RTE is configured to extract output data in received
frames and write it to configured output sinks.

The RTE process data can be mapped to SRAM or a QSPI HW device.

When hardware offload is enabled all process data by default is mapped to SRAM
by P-Net and the application uses the P-Net API the same way as usual.

To map the process data to a QSPI interface the application uses the P-Net API functions
:cpp:func:`pnet_mera_input_set_rte_config` for input data and
:cpp:func:`pnet_mera_output_set_rte_config` for output data.
When a QSPI data source or sink is configured the process data
is handled by the configured HW device and not by the application.
The P-Net stack still keeps a copy of the process data in SRAM
and the application can read the process data from this copy.

All P-Net interactions with the LAN9662 RTE is done through the MERA library provided by Microchip.
Detailed information about the LAN9662 and the RTE can be found in the references in section :ref:`lan9662-resources`.

Table below shows how the the P-Net API for handling the process data is affected when RTE is enabled.

Build-time configuration
------------------------
Support for LAN9662 features in the P-Net stack is enabled using the following CMake options:

- PNET_OPTION_DRIVER_ENABLE - Enable the P-Net support for hardware drivers in general
- PNET_OPTION_DRIVER_LAN9662 - Enable the support for the LAN9662 driver
- PNET_OPTION_LAN9662_SHOW_RTE_INFO - Print the RTE configuration to the application log

The LAN9662 sample is built with the following P-Net options::

    set(HAS_PNET ON)
    set(BUILD_TESTING OFF)
    set(PNET_OPTION_DRIVER_ENABLE ON)
    set(PNET_OPTION_DRIVER_LAN9662 ON)
    set(PNET_OPTION_LAN9662_SHOW_RTE_INFO OFF)
    set(PNET_MAX_PHYSICAL_PORTS "2" CACHE STRING "LAN9662 2 Ports" FORCE)
    set(PNET_MAX_SLOTS "13" CACHE STRING "LAN9662 sample application" FORCE)
    set(PNET_MAX_SUBSLOTS "4" CACHE STRING "LAN9662 2 Ports" FORCE)
    set(LOG_LEVEL "FATAL" CACHE STRING "Enable logging" FORCE)


Run-time configuration
----------------------
The build-time configuration described in previous section enables the support for the LAN9662 driver.
The application decides if the hardware offload shall be used when p-net stack is initialized.
The hardware offload feature is enabled using the driver_enable parameter part of
the configuration (pnet_cfg_t) passed to P-Net during initialization.
When set to true, LAN9662 specific CPM and PPM drivers are used in the P-Net stack and handling of cyclic data frames
is handed off to the LAN9662 RTE during AR establishment.
The driver_config parameter contains base IDs for various resources in the LAN9662 RTE.
In a system where P-Net is the only feature using the RTE these don't need to be considered.
If not, the IDs must be set not to conflict with other parts of the system.

Input data is mapped to QSPI using the operation :cpp:func:`pnet_mera_input_set_rte_config`.
Output data is mapped to QSPI using the operation :cpp:func:`pnet_mera_output_set_rte_config`.


EVB-LAN9662
-----------
Both the default P-Net sample application and the LAN9662 sample application can be run on the EVB-LAN9662.
Utility scripts for configuration of LEDs and buttons and starting the applications are provided in
the :file:`p-net/samples/pn_dev_lan9662/` directory.
EVB-LAN9662 Features used by P-Net samples:

- Shell is available on the EVB-LAN9662 USB connector marked ``CONSOLE``. Use 115200 baud, no flow control.
- The io-fpga is connected to the EVB-LAN9662-Carrier USB connector marked ``FPGA SPI``.
- Two Ethernet ports are supported. Sample scripts show how to configure a network bridge.

============== ======================= =========================================== ============

Note that the I/Os on slots 11 and 12 are available at the EVB-LAN9662 pin lists IN-A and OUT-A.
The sample application gsdml file is available at :file:`/p-net/samples/pn_dev_lan9662/`.

The application has three modes of operation. The mode is a runtime configuration defined by the mode (-m) argument:

-m none     RTE disabled. Application process data mapped to shared memory.
-m cpu      RTE enabled. RTE maps process data to SRAM. Application process data mapped to shared memory.
-m full     RTE enabled. RTE maps process data to QSPI. Application process data mapped to io-fpga.

**Mode none**

In this mode the input/output data is mapped to shared memory.
The shared memory can be accessed using the pn_shm_tool or by another
application in the system. HW offload is disabled and the default data
path of the P-Net stack is used.

The shared memory is accessed using the pn_shm_tool. Run ``/usr/bin/pn_shm_tool -h`` for further details.

**Mode cpu**

This mode shows how to use the P-Net with LAN9662 RTE SRAM data.
Also in this mode the input/output data is mapped to shared memory.
The shared memory can be accessed using the pn_shm_tool or by another
application in the system. HW offload is enabled and the cyclic data is
is handled by the LAN9662 RTE. To a user of the application it is no
difference to the "none"-mode. However P-Net copies application process
data to SRAM which is mapped to the cyclic data frames handled by the RTE.

The shared memory is accessed using the pn_shm_tool. Run ``/usr/bin/pn_shm_tool -h`` for further details.

**Mode full**

This mode shows how to use P-Net with LAN9662 RTE QSPI data.
Shared memory is not used. The input/output data is mapped to
the IO-FPGA on the EVB-LAN9662.

The fpga is accessed using the mera-iofpga-rw tool. Run ``mera-iofpga-rw -h`` for further details.
Note that Port A outputs and Port A inputs can be accessed without the mera-iofpga-rw tool since they are physically available on the EVB-LAN9662.

Note that the mera-iofpga-rw tool is run on a host system, not on the LAN9662.
See :ref:`lan9662-resources` for further information on the io-fpga tool.

Building the LAN9662 Sample Application
---------------------------------------
Note: Add step by step guide describing how to build the LAN9662
sample application and which Microchip resources to download
when that information is available.


P-Net on LAN9662 Application Summary
------------------------------------
- To map process data to QSPI the application must use the operations :cpp:func:`pnet_mera_output_set_rte_config` and :cpp:func:`pnet_mera_input_set_rte_config`.
- If process data is handled by the application and not mapped to QSPI the hardware offload can be enabled and used without any change in the application. API usage is identical except that the hardware offload is enabled during stack initialization.
- :file:`p-net/samples/pn_dev_lan9662/switchdev-profinet-example.sh` shows the required systems configurations for a 2 port Profinet device application.
