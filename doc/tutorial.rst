Tutorial
========

In this tutorial we will run the p-net Profinet device stack and its
sample application on a Raspberry Pi, which is an embedded Linux board.
You can optionally connect two LEDs and two buttons to the Raspberry Pi
for easier interaction with the sample application.

We will use a second Raspberry Pi as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller =
IO controller) running Codesys soft PLC.


Sample app description
----------------------
The sample application implements a Profinet IO-device, having an
IO-module with 8 digital inputs and 8 digital outputs. The example uses
two buttons connected to inputs and one LED connected to one of the outputs
(we call this the "data LED").

A second LED is connected as the Profinet "Signal LED", which can be flashed in
order to identify a particular IO-device if you have many devices.

.. image:: illustrations/TutorialOverview.png

The LED1 ("data LED") on the IO-device is controlled by the IO-controller
(PLC), and is normally flashing.  With Button1 on the IO-device it is
possible to tell the PLC to turn on and off the flashing of the LED.

Button2 triggers sending an alarm from the IO-device to the PLC.

* Button1: Setting cyclic data value
* Button2: Trigger alarm, setting diagnosis etc
* LED1: Data LED
* LED2: Signal LED

The resulting Ethernet traffic can be studied (see below).


Notes to advanced users
-----------------------
The IO-device sample application can be running on:

* Raspberry Pi (as described in this tutorial)
* Some other embedded Linux board
* A Linux laptop (or a Linux guest in Virtualbox)
* An embedded board running an RTOS, such as RT-kernel

Instead of a Codesys soft PLC running on a second Raspberry Pi, you can
use a Siemens Simatic PLC. See another page of this documentation.


Available files
---------------
The ``sample_app`` directory in the p-net repository contains the source code
for this example. It also contains a GSD file (written in GSDML), which tells
the IO-controller how to communicate with the IO-device.

Those parts of the sample application that are dependent on whether you run
Linux or an RTOS are located in ``src/ports``.


Modules and slots
-----------------
Slots are locations where you can put modules.

The GSDML file for the sample app defines these modules:

+----------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Module               | Input data (to IO-controller) | Output data (from IO-controller) |
+======================+===============================+==================================+
| 8 bit in + 8 bit out | 1 byte                        | 1 byte                           |
+----------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| 8 bit in             | 1 byte                        |                                  |
+----------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| 8 bit out            |                               | 1 byte                           |
+----------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+

There are 4 slots for the sample app (in addition to slot 0 which is used by the
DAP module), and for this sample app any of the modules fit in any of
the slots 1 to 4.

In this example we will use the "8 bit in + 8 bit out" module in slot 1.


Set up the Raspberry Pi for running p-net
-----------------------------------------
As the PLC typically will change the IP address of the IO-device,
we recommend that you use a serial cable for communicating with the Raspberry
Pi running the p-net sample application.

To setup Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi, and optionally connect buttons and LEDs,
see "Install Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi (by using a Linux laptop)".

A LED is controlled by the Linux sample app by writing to a file, for example
``/sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value``. A ``0`` or ``1`` will be written to the
file upon LED state changes. This is done by a script, for easy adaptation to
your hardware.

If you do not have a physical LED, you can use an alternate script that
writes to plain text files instead. Usage is described below.


Install dependencies
--------------------
Your Raspberry Pi needs to be connected to Internet via LAN or WiFi to be
able to download software.

In order to compile p-net on Raspberry Pi, you need a recent version of cmake.
Install it::

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install snapd
    sudo reboot
    sudo snap install cmake --classic

Verify the installed version::

    cmake --version

Compare the installed version with the minimum version required for p-net
(see first page).

You also need ``git`` to download p-net. Install it using::

   sudo apt install git


Download and compile p-net
--------------------------
Create a directory::

    mkdir /home/pi/profinet/
    cd /home/pi/profinet/

Clone the source::

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rtlabs-com/p-net.git

This will clone the repository with submodules.

Then create and configure the build::

    cmake -B build -S p-net

Build the code::

    cmake --build build --target install

We used the ``install`` target to install scripts for manipulating IP
settings, control LEDs etc.

Instead of controlling real LEDs, the default behavior is to write LED output
to regular files. If you have connected real LEDs to your Raspberry Pi,
enable the LED control script::

    mv build/set_profinet_leds build/set_profinet_leds.disabled
    mv build/set_profinet_leds.raspberrypi build/set_profinet_leds


Notes to advanced users
-----------------------
If you already cloned the repository without the ``--recurse-submodules``
flag then run this in the ``p-net`` folder::

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Alternate cmake command to also adjust some settings::

    cmake -B build -S p-net -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DUSE_SCHED_FIFO=ON

You can choose any name for the build folder, for instance if you want
to build different configurations.

You can use the ``-j`` flag to ``make`` if you like to enable parallel build.

Depending on how you installed cmake, you might need to run ``snap run cmake``
instead of ``cmake``.

It is possible to specify the location of the submodule repositories.
See the end of this page for details.


Run the sample application
------------------------------
Run the sample app in the build directory::

    cd build

Usage of the IO-device sample application:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ./pn_dev --help

    Demo application for p-net Profinet device stack.

    Wait for connection from IO-controller.
    Then read buttons (input) and send to controller.
    Listen for application LED output (from controller) and set application LED state.
    It will also send a counter value (useful also without buttons and LED).
    Button1 value is sent in the periodic data.
    Button2 cycles through triggering an alarm, setting diagnosis and creating logbook entries.

    Also the mandatory Profinet signal LED is controlled by this application.

    The LEDs are controlled by the script set_profinet_leds
    located in the same directory as the application binary.
    A version for Raspberry Pi is available, and also a version writing
    to plain text files (useful for demo if no LEDs are available).

    Assumes the default gateway is found on .1 on same subnet as the IP address.

    Optional arguments:
        --help       Show this help text and exit
        -h           Show this help text and exit
        -v           Incresase verbosity
        -f           Reset to factory settings, and store to file. Exit.
        -r           Remove stored files and exit.
        -g           Show stack details and exit. Repeat for more details.
        -i INTERF    Name of Ethernet interface to use. Defaults to eth0
        -s NAME      Set station name. Defaults to rt-labs-dev  Only used
                     if not already available in storage file.
        -b FILE      Path (absolute or relative) to read Button1. Defaults to not read Button1.
        -d FILE      Path (absolute or relative) to read Button2. Defaults to not read Button2.
        -p PATH      Absolute path to storage directory. Defaults to use current directory.

    p-net revision: 0.1.0+5965c46

Enable the Ethernet interface and set the initial IP address::

    sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.50 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

Run the sample application::

    sudo ./pn_dev -v

The IP settings are stored to file. If you accidentally have run the application
when IP settings were wrong, use this command to remove the stored settings::

    sudo ./pn_dev -r

Input buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would like to use physical input buttons you must set up the
GPIO files for buttons properly first::

    echo 22 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 27 > /sys/class/gpio/export

Then::

    sudo ./pn_dev -v -b /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value -d /sys/class/gpio/gpio27/value

It is possible to use plain files as inputs instead of physical buttons::

   touch /home/pi/profinet/build/button1.txt
   touch /home/pi/profinet/build/button2.txt
   sudo ./pn_dev -v -b /home/pi/profinet/build/button1.txt -d /home/pi/profinet/build/button2.txt

Manually write ``1`` or ``0`` to a file to simulate the button press and
release::

   echo 1 > /home/pi/profinet/build/button1.txt
   echo 0 > /home/pi/profinet/build/button1.txt

If you only have one terminal, you need to run ``pn_dev`` in the background
to be able to run these commands.
That is done by adding a ``&`` at the end of the command to start ``pn_dev`` .
Later on kill the ``pn_dev`` process by using ``sudo pkill pn_dev``.

LEDs
^^^^
If you use plain files as output instead of LEDs, use this to study the file
for the "Data LED":

    watch -n 0.1 cat /home/pi/profinet/build/pnet_led_1.txt


Set up the PLC
--------------
Now you have installed the sample app on the Raspberry Pi, congratulations!
In order to see it in action, you need to connect it to a PLC.

We suggest that you use Codesys soft PLC.
Install Raspberry Pi OS on the second Raspberry Pi. No serial cable or LEDs are
required.

See "Using Codesys soft PLC" for how to set it up as an IO-controller (PLC).

This is the typical output from the Linux sample application at startup if
you enable verbose output::

Study the resulting communication
---------------------------------
Press Button1 to see the LED1 start flashing. Press it again to stop the
flashing.

By pressing Button2 you can trigger alarms, add diagnosis etc. See the
printout in the console.

On the page "Capturing and analyzing Ethernet packets" is a description given
on how to study the network traffic. If you are interested in the different
packets sent during startup or the cyclic data payload, see the page
"Sample app details".


Adjust log level
----------------
There is logging available in the p-net stack describing the interaction
with the PLC.

If you would like to change the p-net stack log level, run ``ccmake .`` in
the ``build`` directory. It will start a menu program. Move to the
LOG_LEVEL entry, and press Enter to change to DEBUG. Press ``c`` to save
and ``q`` to exit.

You need to re-build the project for the changes to take effect.


Next steps
----------
Great! You managed to get the sample application running.

Try flashing the Profinet signal LED. See description on the page "Using
Codesys soft PLC".

To enable automatic start of the sample application on power on, see the page
"Install Raspberry Pi OS on the Raspberry Pi".

For Profinet members the "ART tester" tool is available for conformance
testing. Run the conformance tests against the sample app to verify that the
stack is compliant. See a separate page on conformance testing in this
documentation.

To experiment with the SNMP features of conformance class B, see the page
"Network topology detection".

Now it is time for you to start developing your own applications. You can use
the sample app as a starting template.
Experiment by modifying the available modules, and the data types they send
and receive. Modify your GSDML file accordingly to explain the IO-device
behavior to the PLC configuration tool.

A separate page is available with a few ideas on how to write you application.
Remember to run the "ART tester" now and then to verify that you stay compliant.


Timing issues
-------------
If running on a Linux machine without realtime patches, you might face timeout
problems. It can look like::

   Callback on event PNET_EVENT_ABORT. Error class: 253 Error code: 6

where the error code most often is 5 or 6.
See the "Real-time properties of Linux" page in this document for solutions, and
the "Using Codesys soft PLC" page for workarounds.


Troubleshooting
---------------
If you have problems establishing a connection to your PLC, connect it
directly to your laptop and run the program Wireshark on the corresponding
Ethernet interface. See another page in this documentation for details on
Wireshark usage.

The PLC will send LLDP frames once per 5 seconds. Study one of these frames
in Wireshark. The "Management Address" block shows the IP address of the PLC.
There are also other blocks describing the MAC address and the port ID.


Advanced users: OSAL
--------------------
OSAL is a generic OS abstraction library that may be used by multiple
projects in a system. To avoid issues with multiple copies of the
library, possibly of conflicting versions, it has been moved to its
own repository.

``cmake-tools`` is a repository that contains common CMake utilities for
RT-Labs projects. It contains a CMake script ``AddOsal.cmake`` that
simplifies use of OSAL. It supports two different use-cases:


1) Automatic download and build of OSAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
During CMake configuration, if OSAL is not found in the system it will
be downloaded and built automatically. For most users this will be the
default.
Run CMake configuration by issuing e.g.::

    cmake -B build -S p-net


2) External OSAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
During CMake configuration, if OSAL is found then p-net will just link
against the external library.
CMake will find the external OSAL library if it is installed in a
default location such as ``/usr/include`` or ``/usr/local/include``. This
could be the case for a native build or a cross-compiled Linux system
with a staging folder.

CMake can also be told of the path to an installed version of OSAL by
setting ``Osal_DIR`` during configuration, like so::

    cmake -B build -S p-net -DOsal_DIR=/path/to/osal/install/cmake

The install folder is produced when running::

    make install

or similar in the OSAL build directory.
